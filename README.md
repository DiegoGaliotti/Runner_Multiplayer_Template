How to Play

Embark on an exciting journey in the multiplayer lobby, where you can not only showcase your unique style but also mingle with friends. Once you've decked out your character, head towards the running door to kick off an exhilarating runner experience. The higher your score, the greater your prowess.

Press the Play button on the title screen to initiate the action. A local player will spawn at the starting point, dashing forward in a race against time. Jump and collect various items to boost your score. Beware! Touching obstacles or plummeting below the terrain will deplete your energy.

Grab health boosts strategically to replenish your energy and keep the run alive. Throughout the game, your score and recorded time are prominently displayed on the screen.

When the game concludes, your score finds a place on the leaderboard in the lobby. Should you crave more action, hit the Restart button on the world end screen, and the scene will spring back to life.
